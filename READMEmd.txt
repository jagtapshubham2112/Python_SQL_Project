# E-commerce Data Analysis with SQL and Python

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to analyze an e-commerce dataset using SQL and Python. It focuses on answering key business questions through a series of basic, intermediate, and advanced SQL queries. The goal is to extract meaningful insights into customer behavior, sales trends, and overall business performance.

## Database Structure

The dataset consists of several interconnected tables:

1. **customers**
   - Contains customer information, including location details.

2. **geolocation**
   - Provides geographic coordinates for various zip code prefixes.

3. **order_items**
   - Details individual items in customer orders, including product and seller information.

4. **orders**
   - Records information about each customer order, including status and timestamps.

5. **payments**
   - Contains payment information for each order, including payment type and value.

6. **products**
   - Lists the products available in the store, along with their characteristics.

7. **sellers**
   - Contains seller information, including location details.

## Business Problems Solved

### Basic Queries
1. **List all unique cities where customers are located.**
2. **Count the number of orders placed in 2017.**
3. **Find the total sales per category.**
4. **Calculate the percentage of orders that were paid in installments.**
5. **Count the number of customers from each state.**

### Intermediate Queries
1. **Calculate the number of orders per month in 2018.**
2. **Find the average number of products per order, grouped by customer city.**
3. **Calculate the percentage of total revenue contributed by each product category.**
4. **Identify the correlation between product price and the number of times a product has been purchased.**
5. **Calculate the total revenue generated by each seller, and rank them by revenue.**

### Advanced Queries
1. **Calculate the moving average of order values for each customer over their order history.**
2. **Calculate the cumulative sales per month for each year.**
3. **Calculate the year-over-year growth rate of total sales.**
4. **Calculate the retention rate of customers, defined as the percentage of customers who make another purchase within 6 months of their first purchase.**
5. **Identify the top 3 customers who spent the most money in each year.**

## Technologies Used

- **SQL**: To query the relational database and extract relevant information.
- **Python**: For data manipulation, analysis, and visualization using libraries like Pandas and NumPy.
